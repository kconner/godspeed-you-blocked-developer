# Architecture Decisions

This folder is a collection of [documented architecture decisions](http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions).

I started this project in order to learn some modern web technologies, and next I'm interested in service architecture. I'll want to remember what I meant to accomplish with each change.

My goal is that developers should be able to read this archive to understand how the service is architected and why. They should gain context for making decisions about how the architecture should change.
