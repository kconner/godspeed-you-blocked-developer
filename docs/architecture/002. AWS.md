# 002. AWS

## Context

I built the site as a front-end learning experience, using only browser local storage for persisting data. What the app is most missing is permanent data storage. For that it will need a hosted web service beyond GitHub pages.

So, now it's time to figure out cloud service architecture. I've inherited an AWS project elsewhere that isn't in the greatest shape, and my team has ideas about how to do better, and I'd like to try some of those concepts out here on my personal project.

## Decision

I will build a backend system on AWS.

## Status

Accepted

## Consequences

I've got an AWS account. I moved the site implementation into a subfolder and started this collection of documentation.
