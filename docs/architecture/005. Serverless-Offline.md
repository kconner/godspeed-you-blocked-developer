# 005. Serverless-offline

## Context

I can't be doing a deployment to CloudFormation every time I want to test a new line of code. Serverless-offline is a plugin that allows local emulation of AWS Lambda and API Gateway. By running it via node --debug, you can [use it as a debugger from VS Code](https://medium.com/@OneMuppet_/debugging-lambada-functions-locally-in-vscode-with-actual-break-points-deee6235f590).

## Decision

I will use the serverless-offline plugin to run a local copy of my Serverless stack.

## Status

Accepted

## Consequences

It took some doing, but I was able to start the local emulator, call it with curl, see it hit breakpoints in JavaScript, and use source maps to hit breakpoints in TypeScript. This is good.

I was already wary of relying on Serverless instead of using CloudFormation directly. Now I am concerned about relying on plugins instead of first party functionality. At this point I have to be careful about adopting tools that might be poorly maintained. But at the moment, this is the best solution I've found.
