# 001. Node, NPM, TypeScript, React, Redux, and Webpack

## Context

I was once a web developer when jQuery and CSS 2 were the new hotness. I did a lot of web 1.0, single-server work. Then I spent many years building iOS apps. These days I'm interested to be more of a generalist.

In the fall of 2017, I learned some TypeScript and thought it was great. JavaScript is JavaScript, and I like strong types, and TypeScript makes that happen, so it was an instant favorite.

I decided to learn some more web technologies. For browser apps that means React and Redux, which is commonly used with Node, NPM, and Webpack. Learning the common stuff is a good way to get my bearings in the field.

When the idea for this project came to mind, it was a good chance to learn that web stack and catch up my knowledge.

## Decision

I decided to build this site in TypeScript, with React and Redux, on Node, NPM, and Webpack.

## Status

Accepted

## Consequences

I used create-react-app and some TypeScript add-ons to source React, Redux, and Webpack from NPM. I used Node to run a local development environment and Webpack to build the app into a static distribution. GitHub Pages was a suitable place to ship the finished product.

When I had a good working knowledge of NPM, I was comfortable switching to the Yarn executable instead.
