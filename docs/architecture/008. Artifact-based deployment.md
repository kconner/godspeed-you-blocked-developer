# 008. Artifact-based deployment

## Context

At work we've been talking about ideal continuous delivery setups, and a goal we have is to separate our build and deployment processes into discrete steps. Now that I'm using Terraform and I'm looking carefully at how Lambda functions get their code, it's obvious that pointing Lambda at build artifacts in S3 is a good way to do that. So, I should have a build-package-archive process for the API (and in the future for other components), and a plan-verify-deploy process for Terraform.

## Decision

I will archive artifacts as a build step, and refer to them in deployment configuration.

## Status

Accepted

## Consequences

In the API, I changed from deploying with Serverless to packaging an artifact and archiving it to S3, keyed by the GitHub commit sha. In Terraform, I referred to the artifact in such a way that you just need to know which commit's artifacts you are provisioning.

The S3 bucket for artifacts is shared among all stages, so you package a build once and deploy it to all environments. The environment itself is not considered during the build process.
