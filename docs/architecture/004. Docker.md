# 004. Docker

## Context

So I'm arranging the project, and I'm trying to think about how to make a development environment include the right versions of aws-cli, Serverless, and other tools. Docker is the way I've done that recently, so let's try it.

If I make Lambda functions, for instance, I can use a Docker container to create a local execution environment running AWS's same Python or Node version, without interfering with my own system's configuration.

If I make a CI/CD pipeline, the same Docker container can be used to perform tests and deployments.

## Decision

I will use Docker to create an environment for working on the cloud provisioning project.

## Status

Accepted

## Consequences

I was able to make a Docker container that comes loaded with aws-cli and Serverless, add a sample Serverless configuration, pass AWS credentials from a local profile when launching the container, and deploy to AWS. I was able to quit and relaunch the container and tear the stack down again. At the end of my dev cycle there were no resources in AWS.
