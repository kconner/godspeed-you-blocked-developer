# 006. Cognito

## Context

The backend has Lambda functions run by an API gated with an API key and a usage plan. It is currently reading sample data from a Dynamo table. I have made progress toward storing data in AWS from the client.

Next, each user needs to its own pool of data. That means I need a notion of users. I need some piece of the backend to authenticate someone and vend a token that they can send to the API to get access to a bucket of data.

My ideal is to sign in with GitHub, Google, or some other identity provider and get a token. AWS has a service called Cognito that does a few things, and I don't necessarily understand all of those things, but I think it does the thing I want.

## Decision

I will try to use Cognito to authenticate users.

## Status

Discarded

## Consequences

I built a Cognito user pool, a client representing the website, an identity pool, and roles in CloudFormation via Serverless. I read a bunch of documentation.

But I still didn't understand exactly what the service offers. I tried the AWS Amplify SDK, but it doesn't have type definitions. This was too much work to get off the ground with a prototype.
