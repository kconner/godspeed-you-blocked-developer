# 006. Cognito

## Context

The backend has Lambda functions run by an API gated with an API key and a usage plan. It is currently reading sample data from a Dynamo table. I have made progress toward storing data in AWS from the client.

Next, each user needs to its own pool of data. That means I need a notion of users. I need some piece of the backend to authenticate someone and vend a token that they can send to the API to get access to a bucket of data.

My ideal is to sign in with GitHub, Google, or some other identity provider and get a token. AWS has a service called Cognito that does a few things, and I don't necessarily understand all of those things, but I think it does the thing I want.

## Decision

I will try to use Cognito to authenticate users.

## Status

Accepted

## Consequences

I've built a Cognito user pool and a client representing the website in CloudFormation via Serverless. I need to read more documentation in order to know what's next.
