# 003. Serverless

## Context

Services become unique and fragile when you configure them by hand. I want to have a provisioning strategy before I actually start adding components, so I don't end up with behavior that's hard to reproduce.

I like the principles in the book Infrastructure as Code. It suggests avoiding making changes to services except in an automated, configured manner.

I've had some exposure to the infrastructure provisioning tool [Serverless](https://serverless.com), so I'd like to try using it on this project. Serverless abstracts AWS CloudFormation and similar tools from other cloud vendors.

## Decision

I will use Serverless to describe and provision my AWS components.

## Status

Discarded

## Consequences

I was able to create and update an AWS stack with no consequential components. I was able to do all AWS changes in code that was committed to the repository and versioned.

Terraform, however, is a less magical and more generic tool. I switched to it.
