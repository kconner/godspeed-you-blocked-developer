# 003. Serverless

## Context

Services become unique and fragile when you configure them by hand. I want to have a provisioning strategy before I actually start adding components, so I don't end up with behavior that's hard to reproduce.

I like the principles in the book Infrastructure as Code. It suggests avoiding making changes to services except in an automated, configured manner.

I've had some exposure to the infrastructure provisioning tool [Serverless](https://serverless.com), so I'd like to try using it on this project. Serverless abstracts AWS CloudFormation and similar tools from other cloud vendors.

## Decision

I will use Serverless to describe and provision my AWS components.

## Status

Accepted

## Consequences

I should be able to create a Serverless configuration file and create and update an AWS stack with no consequential components. I should be able to do all AWS changes in code that gets checked in to the repository and versioned.
